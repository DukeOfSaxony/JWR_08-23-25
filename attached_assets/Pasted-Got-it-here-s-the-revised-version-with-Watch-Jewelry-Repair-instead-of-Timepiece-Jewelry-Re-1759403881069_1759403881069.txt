About Brooklyn Watch & Jewelry Repair

For nearly a decade, Brooklyn Watch & Jewelry Repair has been your neighborhood destination for expert watch and jewelry care. From delicate engagement rings to mechanical luxury watches, we treat every piece with the precision and respect it deserves.

Our Journey

Founded 8 years ago with a passion for craftsmanship and a love for preserving memories, our shop has grown through word-of-mouth and dedicated service. What began with simple repairs has evolved into full-scale restoration, custom work, battery replacements, cleaning, polishing, movement overhauls, and more.

What Sets Us Apart
	•	Master-level expertise — our technicians combine traditional horology techniques with modern tools to bring even the most challenging pieces back to life.
	•	Personal touch & integrity — we believe that jewelry and watches aren’t just things — they hold stories, sentiment, and value. You’ll always hear honest assessments, clear explanations, and no surprises.
	•	Attention to detail — every job — from a simple clasp fix to a full restoration — is handled with care, using high-quality parts and materials.
	•	Local & reliable — serving Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and nearby neighborhoods, we pride ourselves on prompt turnaround times and local trust.

Our Promise to You

When you bring us your watch or jewelry, you’re entrusting us with more than a piece — you’re entrusting us with history, emotional value, and precision. We promise to treat it as such, to deliver transparent service, and to walk you through each step from diagnosis to return.
